# Project Report: Exploratory Data Analysis of Hotel Booking Dataset

**Introduction:**
The objective of this project is to conduct an exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the hotel booking dataset to gain insights into various aspects of hotel reservations. The dataset used in this analysis is named "hotel_booking.csv".

**Data Source:**
The primary data source for this project is the "hotel_booking.csv" file, which contains information about hotel reservations including features such as lead time, arrival date, number of guests, booking channel, cancellation status, and more.

**Project Overview:**
The EDA process involves several key steps to understand the characteristics and patterns within the dataset:

1. Checking for outliers in the 'adr' (average daily rate) column and removing extreme values.
2. Visualizing reservation status for each hotel type (resort hotel and city hotel) and calculating the percentage of cancellations.
3. Plotting the average rate of hotels per year and every six months to observe trends over time.
4. Visualizing reservation status per month to identify seasonal patterns.
5. Analyzing the top 10 countries with reservation cancellations to understand geographical trends.
6. Exploring the total count of online and offline bookings, as well as cancellations, and visualizing the average daily rate over time.

**Project Files:**
The project files include:
- hotel_booking.csv: The dataset containing hotel reservation information.
- hotel-booking.pdf: The code used for conducting the exploratory data analysis, provided in PDF format.
- hotel_booking.csv: The code used for conducting the exploratory data analysis, provided in CSV format.

**Key Findings:**
1. The average daily rate (ADR) column had outliers, which were removed to ensure data integrity.
2. City hotels had a higher percentage of cancellations compared to resort hotels.
3. The average rate of hotels showed variations over time, with potential seasonal trends.
4. Reservation cancellations varied across different countries, with certain countries experiencing higher cancellation rates.
5. Online travel agencies (TA) accounted for the majority of bookings, followed by offline TA/TO and group bookings.
6. The average daily rate exhibited fluctuations over time, indicating potential price dynamics in the hotel industry.

**Conclusion:**
The exploratory data analysis provided valuable insights into hotel reservations, including cancellation patterns, booking channels, and pricing trends. Further analysis and modeling can be conducted to develop predictive models for booking cancellations and pricing optimization strategies.

**Recommendations:**
Based on the findings of the EDA, the following recommendations are proposed:
- Implement targeted marketing strategies to reduce cancellation rates, especially for city hotels.
- Explore partnerships with online travel agencies to enhance booking efficiency and reach a broader audience.
- Monitor pricing trends and adjust rates accordingly to maximize revenue and occupancy rates.
